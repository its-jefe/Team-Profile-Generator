# Team Profile Generator

This project is from [UCF Coding Bootcamp][1]

## <u>Description</u>

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
<br>

### Learning Objectives:

- `Object Oriented Programming`<br>
- `Test Driven Development`

## <u>Dependencies</u>

### Node.js <br>

    // modules
    const fs = require('fs')
    const inquirer = require('inquirer')
    const jest = require('jest')

## <u>Walkthrough</u>

[Walkthrough Video][usage] <i>demonstrates functionality and tests passing</i>

## <u>Development</u>

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
  <div style="width: 100%; display: flex; justify-content: space-around">
    <div><b>Mockup</b></div>
    <div><b>Criteria</b> </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between">
  <img src="./development/criteria.png" alt="criteria" width="49%">
  <img src="./development/mockup.png" alt="mockup" height="50%" width="49%">
</div>
<br>

## <u>Tests</u>

<i> Front intro of this video got cut off but its still solid </i>

## <u>Future Developments</u>

* Give the ability to add more roles/positions
  * And possibly add more criteria for positions

<br>

* Want to consolidate functions.. especially inquirer prompt functions
  - There is definitely repeat code that I can get rid of
  - Functions should be dynamic and able to accept any of the classes
    - see comments in on [Team.js][5] file & [issues][6]

<br>

* Need to work on scalability (totally neglected)
  - Works great on large screens but does not scale well, especially with longer emails.. But functionally, I am very happy with this so ðŸ¤«
